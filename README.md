# game_jam_2024_balance
Level Her Up game jam, theme is Balance

TODO:
1. Screens (start, rules, pause, end of round, and end of game, credits)
2. Countdown timer for gameplay & end game if all 3 slots are full
3. Introduce 7 rounds to represent the days of the week, at end of 7 rounds after the end of game screen you can replay
4. Sound effects for orbs going into slots
5. Sounds change based on count of the different orbs placed in slots
6. Orb counter to provide end of round and end of game feedback (e.g. % of week spent working and a message)


Nice to haves
 - Random special event orbs that drop (max 1 per day, 3 per week), unlocks an achievement
 - Art/sprites to represent different days, other UI extras
